This GitHub repository contains the data for the project on stress patterns and pragmatics.

Files included are stimuli for Russian experiment, anonymized tables from Qualtrics, and anonymized analysis tables.

Files for the Russian language experiment are in the "Russian language experiment" folder. Inside are 3 folders: "Stimuli", containing the stimuli for that experiment, "Qualtrics data export", containing the anonymized table exported from Qualtrics, and "Analysis tables", containing the tables with statistics, calculations, and brief analysis. Each table is offered as a CSV and XLSX file, as well as a Numbers file.
